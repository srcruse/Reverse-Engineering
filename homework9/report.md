# Homework 9
## How the Antivirus Works
My antivirus for this version of njRAT has two buttons: `Scan` and `Remove`. When `Scan` is selected, the program will first check if njRAT is a process 
being run, either under its own name or under `windows.exe`. Next, it searches for files created by njRAT. A popup window with results of the scan will 
appear. When the `Remove` button is clicked, the antivirus will stop all njRAT processes or generate a popup letting the user know that none were found. 
Afterward, it will search for and remove malicious files. 

## Instructions for use
In order to access directories where malicious files are hidden, this application should be run as an administrator; otherwise, attempts to delete a file 
generated by njRAT directly in the C: drive of the computer will be blocked.
